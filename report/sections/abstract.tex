\chapter*{Abstract}

In this project we tried to bring the power of CNNs in skin lesions classification. We built a simple CNN model from scratch and we trained it on the popular HAM10000\cite{article4} dataset. We then increased its performances using common machine learning techniques, such as class weighting and data oversampling, to deal with the problem of imbalanced data. We obtained good results and we believe that in the future CNNs will be able to outperforms and probably replace expert dermatologists. In fact, it will be sufficient to provide big quantities of high quality dermoscopitic images to obtain significant results that could be used to increase the survival rate for malignant tumors.
